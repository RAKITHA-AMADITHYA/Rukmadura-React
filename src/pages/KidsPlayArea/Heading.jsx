            Play is an essential component of early childhood development,
            development through play contributes to the cognitive, physical,
            social, and emotional well-being of children. Play is not limited to
            a child’s physical development but it also engages a child’s
            creativity and imagination, their social skills and how they
            interact with others. These are the basic building blocks of
            development, vital for all children.
